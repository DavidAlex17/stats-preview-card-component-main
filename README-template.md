## My process

I started the challenge by doing mobile first then desktop using media queries. i used sass to file structure everything properly to an extent. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### Continued development

For continued development, i believe the area i lack is focusing more on how to properly work with media queries to better preform the responsiveness of the websites i will create. it is a crucial factor in my career to perfect this factor of css. a great opportunity nonetheless. Aside from that, i would like to learn more about sass, although i must admit i am not knowledge in the detail of sass but it is preventing to how to really use sass, if i knew better i would definitely compiled files such as code components for css such as general or parent code even files for media queries. i will work on fixing that as well. to dive more in depth, i believe more code also needs some fixing, such as the specificity of my code and also the sizing elements px, rem, and em.
